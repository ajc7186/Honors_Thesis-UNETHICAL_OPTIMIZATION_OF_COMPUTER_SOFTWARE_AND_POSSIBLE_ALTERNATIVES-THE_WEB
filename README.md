# Honors_Thesis-UNETHICAL_OPTIMIZATION_OF_COMPUTER_SOFTWARE_AND_POSSIBLE_ALTERNATIVES-THE_WEB
Software that was written for the first computers had to leave no room for wasted resources if they didn’t a program simply could not run. Since then, computer hardware has increased exponentially in speed, power, and storage so much that you don’t need to make many optimizations for software to run decently enough. But this has led to developers becoming negligent in optimizing their software and taking advantage of that leftover processing power for ads and telemetry. The problem with this, beyond looking at software on an individual level, is that with multiple of these resource hogs (applications) it can bring even the most powerful modern-day computers to a standstill. The modern web is one of the worst cases of this. My research uses Google Chrome’s built-in developer tools to profile multiple websites of various categories to show how much performance and time is being stolen from the end-user.
